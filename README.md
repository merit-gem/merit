# Defining badge rules

You may give badges to any resource on your application if some condition
holds. Badges may have levels, and may be temporary. Define rules on
`app/models/merit/badge_rules.rb`:

`grant_on` accepts:

* `'controller#action'` string (similar to Rails routes)
* `:badge` for badge name
* `:level` for badge level
* `:to` method name over target_object which obtains object(s) to badge
* `:model_name` (string) define controller's name if it differs from
  the model (like `RegistrationsController` for `User` model).
* `:multiple` (boolean) badge may be granted multiple times
* `:temporary` (boolean) if the receiver had the badge but the condition
  doesn't hold anymore, remove it. `false` by default (badges are kept
  forever).
* `&block`
  * empty (always grants)
  * a block which evaluates to boolean (recieves target object as parameter)
  * a block with a hash composed of methods to run on the target object with
    expected values

## Examples

```ruby
# app/models/merit/badge_rules.rb
grant_on 'comments#vote', badge: 'relevant-commenter', to: :user do |comment|
  comment.votes.count == 5
end

grant_on ['users#create', 'users#update'], badge: 'autobiographer', temporary: true do |user|
  user.name.present? && user.address.present?
end
```

```ruby
# Check granted badges
current_user.badges # Returns an array of badges

# Grant or remove manually
current_user.add_badge(badge.id)
current_user.rm_badge(badge.id)
```

```ruby
# List 10 badge grants in the last month
Badge.last_granted

# List 20 badge grants in the last week
Badge.last_granted(since_date: 1.week.ago, limit: 20)

# Get related entries of a given badge (unreleased)
Badge.find(1).users
```

# Defining point rules

Points are given to "meritable" resources on actions-triggered, either to the
action user or to the method(s) defined in the `:to` option. Define rules on
`app/models/merit/point_rules.rb`:

`score` accepts:

* `:on` action as string or array of strings (similar to Rails routes)
* `:to` method(s) to send to the target_object (who should be scored?)
* `&block`
  * empty (always scores)
  * a block which evaluates to boolean (recieves target object as parameter)

## Examples

```ruby
# app/models/merit/point_rules.rb
score 10, to: :post_creator, on: 'comments#create' do |comment|
  comment.title.present?
end

score 20, on: [
  'comments#create',
  'photos#create'
]

score 15, on: 'reviews#create', to: [:reviewer, :reviewed]
```

```ruby
# Check awarded points
current_user.points # Returns an integer

# Score manually
current_user.add_points(20, 'Optional log message')
current_user.substract_points(10)
```

```ruby
# List top 10 scored users in the last month
Merit::Score.top_scored

# List top 25 scored lists in the last week
Merit::Score.top_scored(
  table_name: :lists,
  since_date: 1.week.ago,
  limit: 25
)
```

# Defining rank rules

5 stars is a common ranking use case. They are not given at specified actions
like badges, you should define a cron job to test if ranks are to be granted.

Define rules on `app/models/merit/rank_rules.rb`:

`set_rank` accepts:

* `:level` ranking level (greater is better)
* `:to` model or scope to check if new rankings apply
* `:level_name` attribute name (default is empty and results in
  '`level`' attribute, if set it's appended like
  '`level_#{level_name}`')

Check for rules on a rake task executed in background like:

```ruby
task cron: :environment do
  Merit::RankRules.new.check_rank_rules
end
```


## Examples

```ruby
set_rank level: 2, to: Committer.active do |committer|
  committer.branches > 1 && committer.followers >= 10
end

set_rank level: 3, to: Committer.active do |committer|
  committer.branches > 2 && committer.followers >= 20
end
```


# To-do list

* Move level from meritable model into Sash
* `ActivityLog` should replace `add_points` `log` parameter
* Extract logging from `Judge` to an Observer. See http://www.rubytapas.com/episodes/21-Domain-Model-Events
* FIXMES and TODOS.
